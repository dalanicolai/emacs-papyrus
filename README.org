#+TITLE: Emacs Papyrus library
#+SUBTITLE: A lightweight document viewer for Emacs


* Introduction
For some reason, the scrolling functionality in the /doc-view/ package is terribly
slow. Also, /doc-view/ is designed in a way that it always converts the complete
document on visiting for the first time in a session, and subsequently again
convert the complete document when the document its display size is changed.
Finally, the doc-view source is a single file.

The purpose of this library is to 're-implement' doc-view in a sensible way, that is:
- create and cache page image when page is first viewed
- for now, use the image-roll display engine by default (another display
  mechanism could optionally be added later)
- write a modular package, with a package core file, and have separate files (or
  sections) for the implementation of each backend

Functionality should get ported from [[https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] and /doc-view/.

*Currently only a simple, but well working, djvu backend has been implemented*
